5. Start docker compose using: `docker compose up -d`. The first time it will take a while because it needs to download and install all packages and build the docker image. Once it has finished you should see: 
```
 ‚úî Network api-proto_default               Created                       0.1s

6. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost/docs to access the API documentation


The web server and the attacks-mitigations database are now running. You can send requests to localhost using the API! üöÄüöÄ
