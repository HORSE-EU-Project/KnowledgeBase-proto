### üìñ ABOUT THE COMMON KNOWLEDGE BASE
Welcome to the HORSE project's Common Knowledge Base development repository.

<img src="./src/images/CKB-architecture.jpg" width="60%" />

The **Common Knowledge Base (CKB)** is an enhanced, AI-powered database designed to centralize and enrich information on cyberattacks and corresponding mitigations.

CKB integrates data from heterogeneous sources‚Äîsuch as CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK, and custom threat intelligence‚Äîand uses generative AI techniques to:
- Merge overlapping or fragmented information across datasets
- Generate human-readable descriptions of attacks and mitigations
- Rank relevant mitigations based on their effectiveness and context

To learn more about the generative AI process used to enhance the content of the CKB, visit the [HORSE-GenAI-CKB repository](https://github.com/martel-innovate/HORSE-GenAI-CKB).

### üõ†Ô∏è API USAGE

The Common Knowledge Base (CKB) offers RESTful APIs to query and interact with its enriched dataset of cyberattacks and mitigations.


**INTERACTIVE API DOCS**

To access the full interactive API documentation, connect to the CKB machine inside a testbed and browse: `http://<host>/docs`. 

For example, using the **UPC testbed**, once connected through the UPC VPN, open a browser and go to: http://10.19.2.18/docs. You now have access to the interactive FastAPI documentation interface, that looks like this:

**QUICK EXAMPLES REQUEST**

To query the CKB service, connect to a machine inside a testbed and open a shell. Use `curl` to performs API calls. For example, using the **UPC testbed**, once connected through the UPC VPN, you can:

Example 1) Retrieve all attacks:
```
curl http://10.19.2.18/allattacks
```

Example 2) Given an attack name, retrieve mitigations:
```
curl -X POST http://10.19.2.18/mitigations -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"attack_name": "nf_exposure"}'
```


**RESPONSE EXAMPLE**

Responses are returned in **JSON** format and include the following information:

- Attack name
- List of relevant mitigations
- Priority ranking for each mitigation
- Required fields for configuration
- A short description

```json
{
  "attack_name": "nf_exposure",
  "mitigations": [
    {
      "name": "filter_malicious_access",
      "priority": 1,
      "fields": [
        { "name": "actor", "value": "" },
        { "name": "response", "value": "" }
      ],
      "description": "Immediately reacts to interactions flagged as hostile to reduce unauthorized data flow or probing."
    },
    {
      "name": "api_rate_limiting",
      "priority": 2,
      "fields": [
        { "name": "limit", "value": "" }
      ],
      "description": "Limits the frequency of requests, protecting exposed APIs from enumeration or brute-force misuse."
    }
  ]
}

```

### ‚öôÔ∏è SETUP REQUIREMENTS
- preferred terminal 
- docker desktop
    - installation guide for Linux: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/
    - installation guide for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
    - installation guide for Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
- docker: check if it is installed using ```docker --version``` in your terminal

### üìÑ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download the repo using git clone 
2. Open Docker Desktop app
3. Open terminal and go into KnowledgeBase-proto
4. Install postgres docker image using `docker pull postgres`. When it's done you should see a list of 
```
710e142705f8: Pull complete
cb628c265f09: Pull complete
```
5. Navigate to the src directory using `cd src`
6. Create the `.env` file: Use the `.env.example` template to create a `.env` file in the `src` folder, then copy the `.env` file into the `app` folder as well.
7. Start docker compose using: `docker compose up -d`. The first time it will take a while because it needs to download and install all packages and build the docker image. Once it has finished you should see: 
```
 ‚úî Network api-proto_default               Created                       0.1s 
 ‚úî Container api-proto-web-server-1        Started                       8.7s 
 ‚úî Container attacks-mitigations-database  Started                       8.7s 
```
8. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost/docs to access the API documentation


The web server and the attacks-mitigations database are now running. You can send requests to localhost using the API! üöÄüöÄ

9. When finished, stop docker compose writing in terminal `docker compose down -v`. Once it has stopped you should see: 
```
 ‚úî Container api-proto-web-server-1        Removed                       0.5s 
 ‚úî Container attacks-mitigations-database  Removed                       0.7s
 ‚úî Network api-proto_default               Removed                       0.3s 
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è LATEST UPDATES 
If this is not the first time you run the Common Knowledge Base and you want to use the latest updates, please follow the instructions:
1. Open Docker desktop
2. Delete "knowledgebase-proto" from containers

<img src="./src/images/knowledgebase-proto-docker-desktop.png" width="60%" />

3. Delete "knowledgebase-proto-web-server" from images

<img src="./src/images/docker-desktop-images.png" width="20%" /> <img src="./src/images/delete-image-web-server.png" width="80%" />

4. Go into the main folder of this repo, called "KnowledgeBase-proto". If there is a folder called "db", delete it.

<img src="./src/images/delete-db.png" width="15%" />

5. Now that your environment is clean again, follow "Usage Instructions" starting from point 5: `docker compose up -d`.

Enjoy üòÄ
